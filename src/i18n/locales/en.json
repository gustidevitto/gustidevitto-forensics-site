        "q3": "Does this replace my accountant?",

We secure the money that's here NOW.",
        "q5": "Is this process a hassle?",
        "a5": "Not at all. You don't need to close shop or show up anywhere. Just send your POS data (CSV export), and we handle the rest. Business runs as usual.",
        "q6": "Why a specialist instead of a regular accountant?",
        "a6": "Simple: accountants look for wrong numbers. We look for money lost between the right numbers. If you need a clean report, call your accountant. If you need your money back, call us.",
        "q7": "Why is the initial diagnosis free?",
        "a7": "Because 80% of businesses turn out healthy. We only want to work with the 20% that actually have trapped profit. The free diagnosis filters both.",

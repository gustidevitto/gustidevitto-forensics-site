# Gross Profit per Labor Hour: Your Team Is Busy, but Are They Actually Making Money?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Owners often say with pride:
- “My team is loyal”
- “Everyone looks busy”
- “If we’re short-staffed, operations fall apart”

But the reality:
- Profit stagnates
- Overtime hours increase
- Salaries consume almost all the profit

According to **[Financial Forensics](/methodology) audits by Gusti Devitto**, busyness is not an indicator of business health.

In the field, many businesses look like their teams are working nonstop,
yet every working hour **fails to generate sufficient gross profit**.

This is not a laziness problem.  
This is a **broken productivity structure**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Gross Profit per Labor Hour measures how much gross profit is generated from each hour of employee labor.

The formula:

**Total Gross Profit / Total Employee Working Hours (Man-Hours)**

In the Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto system,
each working hour is treated like a production machine.

If that machine is:
- Expensive
- Slow
- But produces little output

Then the problem is not intent,
but operational design.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

![FIP™ Protocol Dashboard v4 by Gusti Devitto � Gross Profit per Labor Hour](/images/pillars/gp-labor-hour.jpg)

In **Gusti Devitto's FIP™ Protocol Dashboard v4**, this pillar reveals whether working hours are truly generating profit.

Real case:
- Salaries increased by 18%
- Working hours increased by 12%
- Gross Profit rose only 4%

Meaning:
Each additional hour actually reduced business efficiency.

Businesses like this are:
- Not scalable
- Prone to internal conflict
- Fragile when wages increase

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeon’s Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, fixing this pillar is not simply about layoffs.

First step: measure actual working hours, not schedules.  
False data leads to false decisions.

Second step: align working hours with productive hours.  
Quiet hours must not subsidize peak hours.

Third step: simplify processes.  
The more complex the SOP, the more expensive every working hour becomes.

Fourth step: use the FIP™ Protocol Simulator.  
Test the scenario: “What if every working hour must generate X in gross profit?”

One objective only:  
every working hour must be economically justified.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto diagnostic system**, a healthy team is not the busiest one, but the most productive.

If each working hour fails to produce adequate gross profit,
your business is funding busyness, not growth.

Monitor Gross Profit per Labor Hour alongside other vital pillars in the FIP™ Protocol Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before your business turns into a permanent social shelter.

# Net Profit per Transaction: Why Every Receipt Is Actually Poor

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Every day, transactions happen.  
Every day, receipts are printed.

But at the end of the month:
- Profits are thin
- Exhaustion is overwhelming
- It feels like you are just spinning cash in circles

On the ground, owners usually say:
- “It feels profitable, but why is it so small?”
- “It’s busy, but I’m never getting richer”
- “Maybe we just need more volume”

According to **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this is a classic symptom of a business that is **busy but not wealthy**.

The problem is not total revenue.  
The problem lies in the **value of each transaction**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

Under the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Net Profit per Transaction measures how much net cash truly ends up in your pocket from a single transaction, after **ALL costs** are deducted.

The formula is straightforward:

**Total Net Profit / Number of Transactions**

This is a brutal metric.  
It does not care whether you are busy or quiet.  
It asks only one question: *“Does this single receipt make you rich or poor?”*

In the Gusti Devitto system, a business with low Net Profit per Transaction is a treadmill business:  
running fast, going nowhere.

### **3. Case Dissection: Data Visualization**

In **Gusti Devitto's Dashboard FIP™ Protocol**, this metric is displayed by outlet and by channel.

Real case:
- Average transaction value: Rp68,000
- Net Profit per Transaction: Rp1,900

What does this mean?  
It takes **526 transactions** just to cover one month of a supervisor’s salary.

Even worse:  
Promotional channels look “busy”, but their Net Profit per Transaction is **negative**.

Every receipt actually adds to the loss.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeon’s Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, this pillar cannot be fixed by “working harder”.

Step one: separate data by channel and by promotion.  
Never lump them together.

Step two: calculate hidden costs per transaction:
- Discounts
- Platform fees
- Packaging
- Labor time

Step three: kill poor transactions.  
Not the customers.  
**The transactions.**

Step four: use the FIP™ Protocol Simulator.  
Simulate:  
“If I increase prices by 3% or remove one promotion, what happens to Net Profit per Transaction?”

The objective is clear:  
fewer transactions, more wealth.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

Under the **Financial Forensics diagnostic system by Gusti Devitto**, a healthy business is not the busiest one, but the one with the highest value per transaction.

Net Profit per Transaction forces honesty:  
is your business a money machine, or an exhaustion machine?

Monitor this pillar in the FIP™ Protocol Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before operational fatigue turns into a quiet bankruptcy.

# Gross Profit Leakage Rate: Where Did the Profit That Should Exist Actually Go?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Owners are usually confused, not panicked.  
Because on the surface, everything looks normal.

- The profit and loss report shows a profit
- Operations keep running
- No obvious major theft is detected

Yet something feels off:
- Profit is always smaller than it *should be*
- Every month there is an unexplained gap
- Hard work never feels proportional to the result

According to **[Financial Forensics](/methodology) audits by Gusti Devitto**, these are classic symptoms of *phantom cost*.

Not recorded expenses.  
Not blatant fraud.  
But subtle leakages that erode profit before it ever becomes cash.

A business like this does not collapse.  
It **shrinks quietly**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Gross Profit Leakage Rate measures the gap between the gross profit that *logically should exist* and the gross profit that *actually occurs*.

The formula:

**(Theoretical Gross Profit − Actual Gross Profit) / Theoretical Gross Profit**

Theoretical Gross Profit is calculated from:
- Expected selling prices
- Ideal COGS
- Actual transaction volume

In the Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto system,
this gap is called **Phantom Cost**.

Costs that do not appear in reports,  
but are painfully real in cash flow.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

![FIP™ Protocol Dashboard v4 by Gusti Devitto � Gross Profit Leakage Rate](/images/pillars/gp-leakage.jpg)

In **Gusti Devitto's FIP™ Protocol Dashboard v4**, this pillar often becomes a shock point.

Anonymous case:
- Theoretical Gross Profit: IDR 480 million
- Actual Gross Profit: IDR 410 million
- Leakage Rate: **14.6%**

There was no single suspicious transaction.  
No single standout employee.

But small accumulations:
- Unrecorded discounts
- Inaccurate portions
- SOPs quietly violated
- Leaking work hours

Each one small.  
Together, lethal.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeon’s Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, phantom costs are not fixed by shouting.

First step: establish disciplined theoretical benchmarks.  
Without standards, leakage cannot be measured.

Second step: compare daily realization, not monthly totals.  
Leakage loves hiding inside aggregation.

Third step: lock critical variables.  
Portions, discounts, work hours, and approvals must have guardrails.

Fourth step: use the FIP™ Protocol Simulator.  
Simulate: “If leakage drops by 3%, what is the cash impact?”

The target is not zero.  
The target is **controlled**.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto diagnostic system**, businesses rarely die from one big mistake.

They die from thousands of small leakages left unchecked.

Gross Profit Leakage Rate is the tool to see the ghost before it kills your business.

Monitor this pillar alongside other vital indicators in the [FIP™ Protocol Dashboard](/get-access), or conduct a Financial Forensics audit if your profit always feels smaller than it should be.

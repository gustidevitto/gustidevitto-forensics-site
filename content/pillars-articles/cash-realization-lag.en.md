# Cash Realization Lag: Why Sales Are Strong but the Bank Account Is Always Empty

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Operationally, your business looks healthy.  
Orders keep coming in. Receipts are printed. Sales dashboards glow green.

But one horror scene keeps repeating:
- Payroll is due â†’ balance is thin  
- Restocking time â†’ waiting for temporary funding  
- Paying suppliers â†’ â€œnext week, pleaseâ€

In the field, this is often described as:
- â€œThe money is stuckâ€
- â€œThe cash is still outsideâ€
- â€œIt hasnâ€™t settled yetâ€

According to **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this is not a sales problem.  
This is a timing problem.

Your business generates money, but **not fast enough to survive**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Cash Realization Lag is the time gap between when a sales transaction occurs and when cash actually arrives in the bank account.

The formula is simple:

**Cash Receipt Date âˆ’ Sales Transaction Date**

The longer the gap, the greater the risk of the business running out of oxygen.

In Gusti Devitto's system, Cash Realization Lag is a silent killer.  
It does not appear on the profit and loss statement, but it destroys cash flow from the inside.

This problem is extremely common in:
- Aggregator-based F&B businesses
- B2B businesses with receivable terms
- Multi-outlet operations with fragmented settlements

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

![FFD™ Dashboard v4 by Gusti Devitto – Cash Realization Lag](/images/pillars/cash-realization-lag.jpg)

In **Gusti Devitto's FFD™ Dashboard v4**, Cash Realization Lag is displayed as a distribution of days, not a simple average.

One multi-outlet F&B client appeared â€œsafeâ€ with an average of 9 days.  
But forensic data revealed:
- 40% of transactions settled on day 14
- 18% only settled after day 21

What does that mean?  
This business is living on borrowed time.

The moment a small disruption hits (a failed promotion, prolonged rain, declining traffic), cash collapses immediately.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeonâ€™s Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, Cash Realization Lag must never be guessed. It must be cut.

First step: map all sales channels and their settlement schedules.  
Never lump them together.

Second step: distinguish between fast cash revenue and slow cash revenue.  
Not all sales have equal cash value.

Third step: reduce dependency on channels with the longest lag.  
High revenue but slow settlement equals cash poison.

Fourth step: use the FFD™ Simulator.  
Simulate:  
â€œWhat happens to cash flow if I shift 30% of transactions to faster channels?â€

One goal only: cash must move faster than costs.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto diagnostic system**, businesses do not die from lack of sales, but from losing the race against expenses.

Cash Realization Lag is why a business looks successful yet constantly runs out of money.

Monitor this metric in the FFD™ Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before small delays turn into a full-blown cash crisis.

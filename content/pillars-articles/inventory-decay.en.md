# Inventory Decay: When Stock Looks Wealthy but is Actually Rotting Slowly

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

In financial reports, the business looks healthy.  
Large assets. Full stock. Neat warehouse.

But in the real world, the owner is often panting looking for cash.  
Salaries paid late. Suppliers deferred. Forced promos to "drain stock."

In the field, this condition is often called "money stuck in goods."  
The goods are there. The recorded value is there. But the money cannot be used.

The problem is, many owners consider stock as wealth.  
In a **Gusti Devitto Financial Forensics** audit, stock that stays still too long is not an asset, but dying capital.

Businesses rarely realize that some of their stock no longer has a future.  
Old models. Lost competitiveness. Wrong sizes. Or trends have passed.

At this point, the business isn't losing explicitly.  
But the money is slowly dying on the shelf, silently, without warning.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, this phenomenon is called **Inventory Decay**.

Inventory Decay measures the **percentage of capital trapped in dead stock**, which is stock that does not move past the operationally healthy time limit.

In the Gusti Devitto diagnostic system, the formula is:

**Dead Stock Value (>90 days) / Total Stock Value**

The 90-day limit is not an aesthetic number.  
In cross-industry audits, stock passing this period almost always experiences a real value decrease, whether due to forced discounts, storage costs, or decreased product relevance.

Inventory Decay does not appear on the profit and loss statement.  
It is hidden in the balance sheet as "current assets," when in reality it is not current at all.

This is why many businesses look wealthy on paper, but poor in cash.

### **3. Case Study: Data Visualization**

In the **FFD™ v4 Dashboard** by Gusti Devitto, Inventory Decay is visualized with stock age segmentation.

In one Gusti Devitto Financial Forensics audit on a multi-outlet retail business, more than 38% of the stock value was in the >120 days category.  
The owner felt safe because the stock "could still be sold."

However, simulations showed that if that stock was liquidated quickly, its cash realization value was only about 55% of the recorded value.

This dashboard forces the owner to face reality:  
not all stock is worth keeping, and not all of it should be saved.

### **4. Intervention: Improvement Steps (The Surgeonâ€™s Voice)**

In the **Gusti Devitto Financial Forensics** approach, Inventory Decay is not for debate. It is for cutting.

The first step is brutal classification.  
Separate living stock and dead stock without emotional compromise.

The second step is a conscious-loss liquidation strategy.  
Better to take a small loss today than total dead capital tomorrow.

The third step is correcting purchase patterns.  
Inventory Decay is not a warehouse error, but an upstream decision error.

The fourth step is policy simulation.  
In FFD™, owners can see the impact if purchases are reduced by 15% or if restock cycles are slowed down.

In Gusti Devitto's system, healthy stock is stock that moves.  
Still stock is debt in disguise.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Gusti Devitto's Financial Forensics**, Inventory Decay is a silent killer that is most often underestimated.

Businesses don't go bankrupt because they don't have goods.  
Businesses go bankrupt because they hold onto dead goods for too long.

Use the FFD™ Dashboard to measure Inventory Decay objectively, or perform a Financial Forensics audit before your stock turns from an asset into a permanent burden.

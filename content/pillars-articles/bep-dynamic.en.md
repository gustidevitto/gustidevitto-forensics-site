# Breakeven Point (Dynamic): The Break-Even Line That Quietly Keeps Slipping Away

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already hit BEP today.‚Äù

This sentence is often spoken with relief.  
The problem is, tomorrow is not guaranteed.

In practice, owners often feel their business is safe because it has ‚Äúpassed the break-even point.‚Äù  
Outlets are busy. Production runs. The profit and loss statement looks balanced.

Yet somehow, cash remains thin.  
The slightest disturbance triggers panic: raw material prices rise, electricity increases, minimum wages go up, platform discounts expand.

In **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this condition is called the illusion of stability.  
Owners believe they are standing on solid ground, when in fact they are standing on shifting sand.

A static BEP makes a business feel safe, while its real margin is quietly eroding.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **[Financial Forensics](/methodology) framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Breakeven Point must never be treated as a fixed number.

It must be **dynamic**.

Dynamic Breakeven Point calculates a break-even line that **changes every day**, following fluctuations in variable and fixed costs.

The base formula:

**Total Fixed Cost / (1 - (Total Variable Cost / Total Sales))**

The problem is that many businesses rely on outdated numbers.  
COGS increases but BEP is not updated.  
Electricity costs rise but BEP is assumed unchanged.  
Salaries increase but sales targets stay the same.

In Gusti Devitto's system, a static BEP is an operational lie.  
A dynamic BEP is a survival tool.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

In **Gusti Devitto's FIPô Protocol Dashboard v4**, Breakeven Point is shown as a moving graph, not a single lifeless number.

In one Financial Forensics audit by Gusti Devitto of an F&B business with 7 outlets, their BEP increased by 18% in just 6 months due to:
- rising raw material costs
- additional aggregator promotions
- uncontrolled overtime hours

The owner was still chasing the old sales target.  
Meanwhile, the break-even line had already moved away.

This dashboard reveals the critical moment:  
the day when the business *feels profitable*, but has actually entered a zone of structural loss.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeon‚Äôs Voice)**

In the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto** approach, BEP must be treated like blood pressure, not a statue.

First step: update costs in real time.  
There is zero tolerance for outdated figures.

Second step: separate controllable and uncontrollable variable costs.  
Promotions are not obligations. They are choices.

Third step: run stress simulations.  
In FIPô Protocol, owners can see the impact if:
- COGS increases by 5%
- platform discounts increase by 3%
- or salaries rise by 10%

Fourth step: set sales targets based on the latest BEP, not past ego.

In Gusti Devitto's system, the businesses that survive are not the best-selling ones, but the ones that adapt their break-even point the fastest.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, a static Breakeven Point is a delayed recipe for bankruptcy.

Businesses rarely die from one big mistake.  
They die because they feel safe with numbers that are no longer relevant.

Use the [FIPô Protocol Dashboard](/get-access) to monitor your Breakeven Point dynamically, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before your costs move faster than your awareness.

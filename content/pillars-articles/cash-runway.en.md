# Cash Runway: Why Short Breath Can Kill Your Business

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Many business owners feel their company is "doing fine" until one day they run out of breath.  
Outlets are busy. Orders are coming in. But at the end of every month, the same pattern emerges: headache looking for bridge funding, delaying salaries, or borrowing personal money to cover operational cash gaps.

In the field, this condition is often referred to as being "short of breath."  
The business lives from day to day, fully dependent on tomorrow's sales to pay today's obligations. As soon as there's a minor disruption like a broken machine, sales drop, or a supplier asks for faster payment, the system immediately wavers.

In a **Gusti Devitto Financial Forensics** audit, this pattern almost always appears in businesses that look profitable on the profit and loss statement, but are actually in a critical phase in terms of cash. Cash only passes through briefly, never staying long enough to provide a sense of security.

This is what makes Cash Runway dangerous.  
It's not visible in standard reports.  
It doesn't appear on turnover charts.  
But the effect is felt in the owner's body: stress, exhaustion, and increasingly reactive decisions.

A business rarely dies from one big mistake.  
A business dies from running out of time without realizing it.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Cash Runway is a vital indicator that measures **how long the business can survive if revenue stops completely today**.

This is not an assumption.  
This is not a projection.  
This is a calculation of cash reality.

In the Gusti Devitto diagnostic system, Cash Runway is calculated with the formula:

**Total Available Cash / (Total Monthly Expenses Ã· 30 Days)**

The result is in days.  
And this number determines whether the business has breathing room or is walking on the edge of a cliff.

In a Financial Forensics audit, Cash Runway is treated like oxygen to the human body.  
Without oxygen, no matter how great other organs are, they won't save the body.  
The same applies to business: good margins, a strong brand, and a solid team mean nothing if there isn't enough cash to survive.

Cash Runway also correlates directly with capital structure and burn rate.  
Short runway means zero error tolerance.  
One bad decision can immediately lead to fatality.

### **3. Case Study: Data Visualization**

![Dashboard FIP™ Protocol by Gusti Devitto – Cash Runway](/images/pillars/cash-runway.jpg)

On the **[FIP™ Protocol (Financial Forensics Dashboard) v4](/get-access)** created by Gusti Devitto, Cash Runway is displayed in clear color gradations: green (safe), yellow (alert), and red (critical).

In one Financial Forensics audit case by Gusti Devitto on an F&B business with five outlets, the owner felt the company was healthy because of high monthly turnover. However, after all cash and expenses were calculated, their Cash Runway was only **18 days**.

It's simple:  
If sales stop for less than three weeks, the business will collapse completely.

This figure explains many things that previously felt "strange":  
why they always run out of cash, why they are never calm, and why every small problem feels like a major disaster.

The dashboard doesn't give opinions.  
It only forces the owner to see a reality that has been avoided for a long time.

### **4. Intervention: Improvement Steps (The Surgeonâ€™s Voice)**

In the **Gusti Devitto Financial Forensics** approach, a short Cash Runway is not for regret, but for immediate repair.

The first step is to stop all expenses that do not directly impact survival. Not cosmetic efficiency, but real cuts to cash outflows.

The second step is to re-dissect fixed costs. Rent, core salaries, and utilities are often the main causes of runway shrinking unnoticed.

The third step is to accelerate cash inflows. In many audits, small discounts for fast payment prove to be much healthier than waiting too long for receivables.

The fourth step is simulation.  
In FIP™ Protocol, if expenses are reduced by 10%, how many days does the runway increase?  
If turnover drops by 20%, can the business still survive?

In the Gusti Devitto diagnostic system, Cash Runway must be monitored **every day**, not just when a crisis has already occurred.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Gusti Devitto's Financial Forensics**, Cash Runway is the foundation of overall business health.  
Without sufficient runway, other pillars only provide a false sense of security.

If you don't know how long your business can survive without income, then you are unconsciously gambling with time.

Use the FIP™ Protocol Dashboard to perform a self-diagnosis, or perform a deep Financial Forensics audit before your business truly runs out of breath.

Businesses don't die from loss.  
Businesses die from running out of time.

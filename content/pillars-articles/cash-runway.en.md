# Cash Runway: How Many Days of Oxygen Does Your Business Have Left?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What the Owner Feels**

**"We’re doing $500k a month. We’re safe."**

This is the classic illusion of the "High-Revenue Victim." 

**Monday Morning, 09:12 AM:**
You check your bank account: $85,000.
**"Not bad," you think.**

**Tuesday Afternoon, 02:45 PM:**
Payroll: $62,000.
Supplier A: $18,000.
Rent: $12,000.
**Total immediate outgoings: $92,000.**

**Current Cash: $85,000.**
**Shortfall: $7,000.**

Suddenly, your "safe" business is suffocating. You are scrambling for a loan, a credit card, or a personal "injection" of cash just to survive until Friday.

According to **Gusti Devitto’s Financial Forensics audit** of 743 businesses, **79% are living in the "Death Zone"**:

- Average Cash Runway: **23 days**.
- 42% of owners don't know their "Cash-Zero Date."
- Average time from "Healthy" to "Crisis": **11 days**.
- **Survival rate of businesses with <30 days of runway: only 14%.**

In the field, this is described as:
- *"Living hand-to-mouth"*
- *"The payroll panic"*
- *"Flying blind without a fuel gauge"*

**Forensic Question:**
If all sales stopped today, 
**exactly which date would your bank account hit zero?**

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

In the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Cash Runway is the single most important survival metric. It is your business's **oxygen supply**.

**The Calculation:**

**Current Cash / Monthly Net Burn Rate**

**Forensic Classification:**
- > 6 Months → **The Fortress** (Antifragile)
- 3-6 Months → **The Safe Zone** (Resilient)
- 1-3 Months → **The Warning Zone** (Volatility risk)
- < 30 Days → **The Death Zone** (Active Suffocation)

**In 743 audits conducted by Gusti Devitto:**
- 79% of businesses are in the "Death Zone."
- **Institutional Trauma:** Most owners only discover their runway is gone when a wire transfer bounces.
- **The Threshold:** A runway of <60 days creates "Owner Panic," which leads to bad decisions, predatory loans, and the eventual collapse of the brand.

Revenue is vanity. Cash is oxygen. **Runway is time.**

### **3. Case Study: Data Visualization**

In Gusti Devitto’s **FIP™ Protocol Dashboard**, Cash Runway is visualized as a "Countdown Clock," not a spreadsheet.

**Real Case (2024 Audit):**
A retail chain with 9 locations. Revenue: $1.2M.
The owner felt "invincible" until the 2023 supply chain shock.

**Forensic Breakdown:**
- Monthly Expenses: $1.15M
- Cash on Hand: $240k
- **Cash Runway: 6.2 days (after payroll).**

**The Reality:**
The business was a "Zombie." It looked alive, but it was structurally dead. One 48-hour delay in a credit card settlement would have caused a total collapse.

After a surgical intervention by Gusti Devitto:
- Aggressive "Inventory Liquidation" ($400k cash freed).
- "Dead Weight" expense cutting ($80k/month burn reduction).
- Re-negotiated "Vendor Terms" (DPO increased by 14 days).

**New Result:**
- Cash on Hand: $620k
- **Cash Runway: 122 days.**

**The owner can finally sleep. The business is finally safe.**

### **4. Intervention: The Surgeon’s Voice**

According to **Gusti Devitto’s Financial Forensics**, you don't fix a short runway by "trying to sell more." 
**You fix it by plugging the holes.**

**Step 1: The Cash Inventory**
Every dollar that isn't cash in your bank is a "trapped asset." We find your dead stock, your late piutang, and your useless prepayments.

**Step 2: Burn Rate Deceleration**
We perform a "Surgical Cut" on non-essential fixed costs. If a cost doesn't directly protect your oxygen, it is a tumor.

**Step 3: The AR/AP Gap Closure**
Collect faster. Pay slower (legally). We widen the gap to ensure cash stays in your account for longer.

**Step 4: Use the FIP™ Simulator**
Run the "Death Scenario": 
*"What happens to my Cash-Zero Date if my biggest client pays 14 days late?"*

**In 245 intervention cases by Gusti Devitto:**
- Average increase in Cash Runway: **+420%** (from 23 days → 120 days).
- **Survival rate: increased from 14% → 86%**.

Target: **180 Days of Oxygen.**

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Gusti Devitto’s Forensic Diagnostic System**, your business is likely suffocating in silence. High revenue doesn't matter if you can't pay your team on Friday.

**Brutal Facts:**
- The average multi-outlet business has **less than 23 days of oxygen**.
- 79% of owners are **one bad month** away from losing everything.
- **Hope is not a fuel source.**

**Forensic Question:**
If all sales stopped today, 
**exactly which date would your bank account hit zero?**

Don't wait for the fuel light to turn red.

Monitor your Cash Runway in the FIP™ Protocol Dashboard or book a Forensic Audit before your "oxygen" runs out permanently.

**Because in business, time is the ultimate luxury.**
**And a short runway is a crash waiting to happen.**

**A business without a runway is a plane without an engine.**
**And a leader who doesn't know their Cash-Zero Date is a pilot with their eyes closed.**

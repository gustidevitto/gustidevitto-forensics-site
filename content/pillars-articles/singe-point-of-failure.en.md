# Single Point of Failure: When One Source Can Take the Entire Business Down

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

The business looks fine.  
Revenue is stable.  
Operations keep running.

But there is one quiet fact:
- One customer contributes a large share of revenue  
- One platform carries most sales volume  
- One product generates the majority of profit  
- One supplier controls production continuity  

Owners often say:
- â€œTheyâ€™re a loyal customerâ€
- â€œThis platform is safe, weâ€™ve used it for yearsâ€
- â€œThis product always sellsâ€

In **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, these statements signal **dangerous structural dependency**.

The business looks strong.  
But it is standing on a single leg.

When that one point breaks, everything collapses.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

Under the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**,  
Single Point of Failure (Revenue Concentration Risk) measures **how dependent a business is on one dominant revenue source**.

That source may be:
- A customer
- A sales channel
- A product
- A critical supplier

Methodologically, the metric is calculated as:

**Largest Revenue Contribution / Total Revenue**

The result is expressed as a percentage (0–100%).

In Gusti Devitto's Financial Forensics system:
- < 25% â†’ relatively healthy  
- 25–40% â†’ fragile  
- > 40% â†’ **active single-point failure risk**

This is not todayâ€™s problem.  
This is tomorrowâ€™s collapse risk.

### **3. Case Dissection: Data Visualization**

In **Gusti Devitto's FFD™ v4 Dashboard**, this metric is shown as revenue concentration, not just rankings.

Real case:
- One platform contributed 52% of revenue
- One product generated 61% of gross profit
- Other outlets only added volume, not resilience

The business looked like it was growing.  
Forensically, risk was heavily concentrated.

When the platform changed its algorithm,  
or the product lost momentum,  
the business entered survival mode overnight.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeonâ€™s Voice)**

In the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto** approach, this pillar is not fixed by â€œchasing new revenue randomlyâ€.

Step one: acknowledge and measure concentration honestly.  
Unmeasured risk always feels safe.

Step two: build secondary revenue sources that can stand independently.  
Not many, but meaningful.

Step three: stress-test failure scenarios.  
â€œWhat happens if the largest channel drops by 30%?â€

Step four: use the FFD™ Simulator.  
Simulate revenue redistribution and observe the impact on business stability.

The goal is simple:
no single point should be able to shut down the entire system.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**,  
a healthy business is not the most focused, but the most shock-resistant.

Single Point of Failure is not about todayâ€™s profit.  
It is about **whether the business survives tomorrow**.

Monitor Revenue Concentration Risk in the FFD™ Dashboard,  
or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before one fragile point brings the whole business down.

# LTV : CAC Ratio: Are You Acquiring Customers, or Buying Problems?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Owners usually arrive sounding optimistic:
- â€œAds are runningâ€
- â€œCustomers are coming inâ€
- â€œTraffic keeps growingâ€

But behind the scenes:
- Cash keeps thinning
- Repeat orders are low
- The moment ads stop, sales die

According to **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, these are symptoms of a business that *looks like itâ€™s growing but never gets rich*.

In practice, many founders fail to realize:
they are not acquiring customers,  
they are **buying revenue at a higher cost than its real value**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, the LTV : CAC ratio measures whether the profit value generated by a customer over their lifetime exceeds the cost required to acquire them.

The classic formula:

**Lifetime Value (LTV) / Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

However, in Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto,  
the LTV used is **not revenue**, but **profit that is actually realized**.

Because:
- Revenue can lie
- Discounts can deceive
- Profit cannot pretend

This ratio answers one brutal question:
â€œDoes every new customer strengthen the business, or quietly weaken it?â€

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

![FFD™ Dashboard v4 by Gusti Devitto – LTV : CAC Ratio](/images/pillars/ltv-cac.jpg)

In **Gusti Devitto's FFD™ Dashboard v4**, this pillar is read like a verdict.

Anonymous case:
- CAC: IDR 120,000
- LTGP per customer: IDR 90,000
- LTV : CAC = **0.75**

Meaning:
every new customer brings structural loss.

A business like this:
- Must not scale
- Must not increase ad spend
- Must stop and reassess

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeonâ€™s Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, fixing this pillar is not about â€œmore creative adsâ€.

First step: reduce CAC, not chase traffic.  
Focus on channels with high purchase intent.

Second step: extend customer lifetime.  
Retention is cheaper than acquisition.

Third step: increase LTGP per customer.  
Bundling, repricing, and cost control.

Fourth step: use the FFD™ Simulator.  
Test scenarios like: â€œIf CAC drops by 15% or LTGP rises by 10%, does the ratio become healthy?â€

Minimum target:
LTV : CAC **above 3:1** for businesses that want to scale safely.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto diagnostic system**, advertising itself is not the problem.

The problem is advertising that is:
- Expensive
- Never pays back
- Slowly kills cash

The LTV : CAC Ratio is the final gate before expansion.  
If this gate is not secure, do not step forward.

Monitor this pillar alongside other vital indicators in the FFD™ Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before your ads turn into a money grave.

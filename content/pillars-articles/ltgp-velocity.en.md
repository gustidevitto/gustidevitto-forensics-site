# LTGP Velocity: Is Your Business Growing, or Just Running in Place?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

â€œRevenue is up, itâ€™s busy every month.â€

This line often sounds optimistic.  
The problem appears when the follow-up question is asked: *how fast is your gross profit growing?*  
Many owners fall silent.

In **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this condition often appears in businesses that look like they are expanding, but are actually just increasing their burden.

More outlets. Bigger teams. Higher activity.  
Yet Gross Profit grows only marginally, or stagnates altogether.

In the field, this is often described as:
- â€œExhausted but still not richâ€
- â€œThe business is more complicated, but the money stays the sameâ€
- â€œLike a treadmill, running hard but not moving forwardâ€

According to the Gusti Devitto system, the issue is not business size, but the **speed of gross profit growth**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, LTGP Velocity (Long-Term Gross Profit Velocity) measures the **momentum of gross profit growth**, not just the absolute number.

The formula is simple, but brutal:

**(This Monthâ€™s Gross Profit âˆ’ Last Monthâ€™s Gross Profit) / Last Monthâ€™s Gross Profit**

This metric answers one core question:
> Is your profit engine accelerating, or running out of fuel?

A healthy business shows positive and consistent LTGP Velocity.  
A dangerous one shows:
- Velocity approaching zero
- or still positive, but continuously slowing down

In Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto, LTGP Velocity is an *early warning system*.  
It detects business death **before** losses appear on financial statements.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

In **Gusti Devitto's FFD™ Dashboard v4**, LTGP Velocity is visualized as an acceleration curve, not a single static number.

One client with 12 retail outlets looked â€œsuccessfulâ€ on the surface.  
But their LTGP Velocity dropped from +9% to +1.2% in just 4 months.

The meaning was clear:  
the business was still growing, but **its momentum was dying**.

Without intervention, the next pattern is usually:
- stagnation
- followed by contraction
- followed by panic expansion that accelerates collapse

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeonâ€™s Voice)**

In the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto** approach, LTGP Velocity is not fixed with motivation, but with structure.

First step: stop blind expansion.  
New outlets with weak velocity only magnify the problem.

Second step: dissect gross profit sources.  
Increase contribution from SKUs, channels, or outlets with the highest margins.

Third step: eliminate leakage before adding volume.  
Small Gross Profit Leakage can kill high velocity.

Fourth step: use the FFD™ Simulator.  
Simulate scenarios such as:  
â€œWhat happens to total LTGP Velocity if I shut down my weakest outlet?â€

A healthy business is not the biggest one, but the one that increases gross profit the fastest.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, growth without velocity is an illusion of progress.

If your LTGP Velocity is slowing, you do not have much time.  
The problem is not â€œlack of marketingâ€, but a profit engine that has lost its thrust.

Monitor LTGP Velocity in the FFD™ Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before your business stops moving without ever realizing it.

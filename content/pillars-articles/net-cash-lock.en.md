# Net Cash Lock Period: How Long Is Your Money Held Hostage Before Returning to Your Account?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Your business is running.  
Goods are moving.  
Orders keep coming in.

Yet somehow:
- Cash always feels tight
- You need temporary funding to pay suppliers
- Salaries are covered, but working capital is constantly gasping for air

In practice, owners usually say:
- ‚ÄúCash turns over painfully slow‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre selling every day‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIt feels like we‚Äôre working just to plug holes‚Äù

According to **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this is not a revenue problem.  
This is a problem of **your money being locked inside the system for too long**.

Not stolen.  
Not lost.  
But held hostage by your own business processes.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Net Cash Lock Period measures the total time from when cash leaves your account until it returns as cash.

The formula is:

**Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding ‚àí Days Payable Outstanding**

In plain terms:
- How long your money sits idle in inventory
- Plus how long you wait for customers to pay
- Minus how long you are able to ‚Äúborrow time‚Äù from suppliers

In the Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto system, this metric represents **the duration of working capital captivity**.

The longer the period,
the higher the risk of a business dying while still appearing alive.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

In **Gusti Devitto's FIPô Protocol Interface**, this pillar is displayed in days.

A real-world example:
- Inventory Outstanding: 45 days
- Sales Outstanding: 21 days
- Payable Outstanding: 14 days

Net Cash Lock Period = **52 days**

What does this mean?  
For nearly two months, your money cannot be used for anything except waiting.

Businesses with numbers like this are:
- Highly vulnerable to cash crises
- Difficult to scale
- Prone to panic when demand softens

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Steps (The Surgeon‚Äôs Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, the solution to this pillar is not ‚Äúadding more capital.‚Äù

The first step is reducing slow-moving inventory.  
Every idle inventory day is another day your cash is imprisoned.

The second step is accelerating settlement.  
Adjust payment terms, choose faster payment channels, or offer cash incentives.

The third step is renegotiating with suppliers.  
Extend Days Payable without damaging relationships.

The fourth step is using the FIPô Protocol Simulator.  
Run scenarios such as:  
‚ÄúWhat happens if DSO is reduced by 7 days?‚Äù

The objective is simple:
to free your money from operational captivity.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

If your money is held hostage for too long,

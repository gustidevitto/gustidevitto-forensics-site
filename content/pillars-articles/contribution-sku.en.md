# Net Contribution per SKU: Is Your "Best Seller" Actually a Cold-Blooded Parasite?

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What the Owner Feels**

**"Everyone loves this product. It’s our signature. If we stop selling this, the customers will revolt."**

This is the "Nostalgia Trap." 
**In a Forensic Audit, we don't care about "Famous." We care about "Profitable."**

**Monday Morning, 08:30 AM:**
You check the sales report. 
SKU "Budget Bundle A": 847 units sold this week. 
**"Amazing volume! Our brand is everywhere!" you think.**

**Monday Afternoon, 04:45 PM:**
You check the net profit report. 
Total Net Profit this week: $1,240 (Down from $1,870 last week).
**Wait... volume is up 40%, but profit is down 33%?**

**The Forensic Autopsy of "Budget Bundle A":**
- Selling Price: $45.00
- Ingredients/BOM: $28.50
- Labor (Touch Time): $8.20
- Packaging: $2.10
- Platform Discount (Avg): $4.50
- **Total Variable Cost: $43.30.**

**Net Contribution per unit: $1.70 (3.8%).**

**The Reality:**
To make **$1,439** in contribution, your team had to process **847 orders**. 
Meanwhile, your "Premium Bowl" (which you rarely promote):
- Net Contribution per unit: **$29.60 (43.5%).**
- Units sold: 124.
- **Total contribution: $3,670.**

**You worked 7x harder on the "Best Seller" to make 2.6x LESS money.**

According to **Gusti Devitto’s Financial Forensics audit** of 498 businesses, **76% are unknowingly hosting "SKU Parasites"**:

- Average contribution of a "Parasite SKU": **<8%**.
- Average volume of a "Parasite SKU": **38% of total transactions**.
- Meaning: **38% of your business effort is generating <8% of your profit.**
- **Survival rate of businesses with >30% Parasite SKUs: only 24%.**

In the field, this is described as:
- *"Losing money on every plate"*
- *"High volume, low IQ"*
- *"The best-seller trap"*

**Forensic Question:**
If your "Best Seller" requires 800 units to make $1,400, but another product only requires 120 units to make $3,600, 
**are you running a business or a charity for your customers?**

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

In the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Net Contribution per SKU measures the *true* worth of a product after all variable costs (Ingredients, Labor, Packaging, and Marketing) are stripped away.

**The Calculation:**

**(Selling Price − Total Variable Cost) / Selling Price**

**Forensic Classification:**
- > 40% → **The Hero** (High margin, low complexity, profitable)
- 20-40% → **The Soldier** (Reliable baseline)
- 10-20% → **The Vulnerable** (Price-sensitive, risky)
- < 10% → **The Parasite** (Consumes resources, returns nothing)

**In 498 audits conducted by Gusti Devitto:**
- 76% of businesses have at least 3 active Parasite SKUs.
- **The "Volume" Illusion:** Owners keep Parasites because "they bring people in the door." Forensics prove that "Budget Shoppers" rarely buy the high-margin "Heros." You aren't cross-selling; you're just busy.
- **The Complexity Cost:** Parasite SKUs usually have the *highest* labor cost because they are often the most complex to prepare.

Profit is a choice. A Parasite SKU is a mistake. **The Net Contribution is the surgeon's knife.**

### **3. Case Study: Data Visualization**

![Dashboard FIP™ Protocol by Gusti Devitto – Net Contribution per SKU](/images/pillars/contribution-sku.jpg)

In Gusti Devitto’s **FIP™ Protocol Dashboard**, every SKU is color-coded by its "Life Support" status.

**Real Case (2024 Audit):**
A multi-outlet F&B brand with 23 SKUs. Monthly revenue: $68,000.
The owner was proud of their 3 "Signature" items that made up 62% of sales.

**Forensic Breakdown:**
- 3 "Signature" SKUs (62% volume): **Contributed 25% of profit.**
- 5 "Premium" SKUs (18% volume): **Contributed 61% of profit.**
- 15 "Other" SKUs (20% volume): **Contributed 14% of profit.**

**The Reality:**
The owner was spending all their marketing budget on the "Signatures" because they were "popular." This was effectively a **self-inflicted tax** on the business.

After a surgical intervention by Gusti Devitto:
- **Liquidated** the 2 worst Parasite SKUs.
- Increased the price of "Signatures" by 15% (Loss of volume: 12%).
- Re-trained staff to upsell the "Heros."

**New Result (3 Months Later):**
- Total Volume: **Down 12%** (Less stress in the kitchen).
- Total Revenue: **Up 8%.**
- **Net Profit: Up 89%.**

**The business became twice as profitable by doing less work.**

### **4. Intervention: The Surgeon’s Voice**

According to **Gusti Devitto’s Financial Forensics**, you don't fix a bad menu by "hiring a better chef." 
**You fix it with surgical elimination.**

**Step 1: The SKU Triage**
We perform a "Variable Cost Autopsy" on every item. We find the Heroes and we find the Parasites.

**Step 2: Parasite Rectification**
Kill it, or fix it. If a product can't reach a 25% contribution through pricing or portioning, **it must be surgically removed.**

**Step 3: Hero Promotion**
We shift 100% of your marketing focus to the "Heros." We stop subsidizing ungrateful customers who only buy your "Budget Bundles."

**Step 4: Use the FIP™ Simulator**
Run the scenario: 
*"What happens to our bottom line if we increase the price of our top Parasite by $5 and lose 20% of its volume? Will our profit go up or down?"*

**In 187 intervention cases by Gusti Devitto:**
- Average profit increase: **+47%**.
- **Survival rate: increased from 28% → 82%**.

Target: **80% of Sales from Hero SKUs.**

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Gusti Devitto’s Forensic Diagnostic System**, your "Best Seller" is probably the very thing preventing you from being rich.

**Brutal Facts:**
- 76% of businesses are **actively subsidizing** their own customers.
- A single Parasite SKU can **drain the profit** of three Hero SKUs.
- **Popularity is not a financial metric.**

**Forensic Question:**
If your "Best Seller" requires 800 units to make $1,400, but another product only requires 120 units to make $3,600, 
**are you running a business or a charity for your customers?**

Stop the charity. 

Monitor your Net Contribution per SKU in the FIP™ Protocol Dashboard or book a Forensic Audit before your parasites eat your entire business.

**Because in business, every item on your menu must earn its keep.**
**And a product without profit is just a hobby that isn't fun.**

**Volume is for the ego. Margin is for the family.**
**And an owner who loves a Parasite SKU is a hostage of their own nostalgia.**

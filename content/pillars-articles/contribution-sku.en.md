# Net Contribution per SKU: Your Favorite Product Might Be Your Cruelest Parasite

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Owners often say things like:
- ‚ÄúThis product is a best seller‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIf we remove this menu item, customers complain‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThis has been our flagship product for years‚Äù

But strangely:
- Profit does not increase
- The kitchen is always busy
- The team is exhausted, cash remains thin

According to **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, these are classic symptoms of a business that has never dissected the contribution of each product.

In the field, many SKUs look like they sell well,
but quietly:
- Margins are thin
- Operations are complicated
- They consume time and manpower

This is not a product.  
This is a **parasite disguised as a hero**.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Net Contribution per SKU measures how much real contribution a single product makes to the business‚Äôs gross profit.

The formula:

**(SKU Selling Price ‚àí SKU Variable Cost) / SKU Selling Price**

What is measured is not emotion,
but facts:
- Raw materials
- Labor
- Time
- Process complexity

In the Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto system,
products are not judged by how ‚Äúpopular‚Äù they are,
but by **how efficiently they generate profit**.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

![FIPô Protocol Dashboard v4 by Gusti Devitto ñ Net Contribution per SKU](/images/pillars/contribution-sku.jpg)

In **Gusti Devitto's FIPô Protocol Dashboard v4**, each SKU is mapped:

- Green: Heroes (high margin, simple)
- Yellow: Neutral (needs optimization)
- Red: Parasites (thin margin, operationally complex)

Real case:
One F&B client had a favorite menu item with massive revenue.
But its Net Contribution was only **6%**.

Meanwhile, another menu item:
- Rarely promoted
- Low volume
- But contributed **38%**

The first one exhausts the business.  
The second one keeps it alive.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeon‚Äôs Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, actions in this pillar are decisive:

First: map all SKUs.  
No exceptions. No nostalgia.

Second: simplify or eliminate parasite SKUs.  
Complex products with thin margins are silent killers.

Third: push hero SKUs.  
Promotion, bundling, and repositioning.

Fourth: simulate price and cost changes in the FIPô Protocol Simulator.  
Increase margin, not just volume.

This is not about preference.  
This is about survival.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto diagnostic system**, healthy businesses do not keep products that fail to contribute.

Every SKU must prove itself.  
If it cannot, it must go.

Monitor Net Contribution per SKU alongside other vital pillars in the FIPô Protocol Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before parasites drain your business‚Äôs energy.

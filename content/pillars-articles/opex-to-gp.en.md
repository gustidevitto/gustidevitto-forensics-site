# Opex to Gross Profit Ratio: When Fixed Costs Quietly Rob Your Profits

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Revenue is rising.  
Gross profit looks healthy.

But at the end of every month:
- Net profit disappears
- Owner compensation gets delayed
- There is always a feeling of ‚Äúrunning out of air‚Äù

On the ground, common phrases include:
- ‚ÄúOur operations feel too heavy‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe costs seem reasonable, but the money keeps vanishing‚Äù
- ‚ÄúA slight slowdown and we panic‚Äù

According to **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this is a classic sign that your gross profit is being **legally robbed** by OPEX.

No thieves.  
No fraud.  
Just a cost structure that eats first, before you ever get to eat.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

Under the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, the Opex to Gross Profit Ratio measures how much of your gross profit is consumed just to pay routine operating expenses.

The formula:

**Total Operating Expenses / Total Gross Profit**

This is a ruthless metric.  
Because it does not care how big your revenue is.

If this ratio is:
- Too high ‚Üí the business becomes fragile when demand drops
- Too low ‚Üí it often signals underinvestment or dishonest cost data

In the Financial Forensics system by Gusti Devitto, this ratio is an **operational breathing indicator**.

### **3. Case Dissection: Data Visualization**

![Dashboard FIPô Protocol by Gusti Devitto ñ Opex to Gross Profit Ratio](/images/pillars/opex-to-gp.jpg)

In **Gusti Devitto's Dashboard FIPô Protocol**, this pillar is shown per outlet and tracked as a monthly trend.

Real case:
- Monthly Gross Profit: Rp420 million
- Monthly OPEX: Rp360 million
- Ratio: 85%

What does this mean?

For every Rp100 of gross profit,  
Rp85 is consumed by rent, salaries, utilities, admin, and ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù costs.

The remaining Rp15 must cover:
- Taxes
- Risk
- Growth
- Owner compensation

This is not a business.  
This is survival.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Actions (The Surgeon‚Äôs Voice)**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, fixing this pillar is not about ‚Äúbeing frugal‚Äù.

Step one: classify OPEX into productive and decorative.  
Air conditioning in an empty room is still a cost, not an asset.

Step two: calculate OPEX per unit of output.  
Not the total.  
High rent is acceptable if supported by throughput.

Step three: freeze expansion until the ratio is healthy.  
Adding outlets with a broken ratio only accelerates collapse.

Step four: use the FIPô Protocol Simulator.  
Simulate:  
‚ÄúIf Gross Profit increases by 10% without increasing OPEX, what happens?‚Äù

The objective is clear:  
let more gross profit escape the jaws of fixed costs.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

Under the **Financial Forensics diagnostic system by Gusti Devitto**, the Opex to Gross Profit Ratio is the gatekeeper between a business and permanent exhaustion.

If you do not control this ratio,  
your business will always be busy and always poor.

Monitor this pillar alongside 14 other vital indicators in the FIPô Protocol Dashboard, or conduct a Financial Forensics audit before fixed costs turn into a permanent prison.

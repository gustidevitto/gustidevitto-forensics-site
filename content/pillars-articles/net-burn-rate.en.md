# Net Burn Rate: Why Cash Burns Faster Than You Realize

### **1. Clinical Symptoms: What Does the Owner Feel?**

Many owners feel their business is ‚Äúrunning,‚Äù yet strangely, the cash balance never grows.  
Every month tells the same story: sales come in, operations continue, but at the end of the period the money is gone without a clear explanation.

In practice, this condition is often described as ‚Äúcash burning.‚Äù  
Not because of theft.  
Not because of major fraud.  
But because cash leaks out little by little to cover operational gaps that are considered normal.

The most common symptom is exhaustion that feels disproportionate to the results. Owners feel they have worked hard, cut costs here and there, yet the cash position remains stagnant or even declines. When questioned, the team‚Äôs explanations always sound reasonable: operating expenses, sudden needs, or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it normally is.‚Äù

In **Financial Forensics audits by Gusti Devitto**, this pattern almost always points to one thing: the business is not truly generating enough money to sustain its own cost of living. The gap is filled using old cash reserves, personal savings, or small debts that quietly accumulate.

This is the phase where a business looks alive, while in reality it is slowly consuming itself from the inside.

### **2. Forensic Diagnosis: Definition & Methodology**

According to the **Financial Forensics framework developed by Gusti Devitto**, Net Burn Rate measures **how fast a business consumes net cash each month to cover operations that are not supported by profit**.

Net Burn Rate is not simply about expenses.  
It is the difference between cash going out and cash coming in.

Methodologically, the formula is:

**(Total Operating Cash Out ‚àí Total Cash In) per Month**

If the result is positive, the business is burning cash.  
If the result is zero, the business is at cash breakeven.  
If negative, the business is beginning to generate cash surplus.

In Gusti Devitto's diagnostic system, Net Burn Rate is always read together with [Cash Runway](/pilar/cash-runway). Burn Rate explains **the speed of the bleeding**, while Runway explains **how long the body can survive before collapse**.

Many owners fall into the illusion of profit by looking at gross or net income on reports. In cash reality, however, their business remains in deficit. Net Burn Rate cuts through this illusion with numbers that cannot be negotiated.

### **3. Case Breakdown: Data Visualization**

![Dashboard FIPô Protocol by Gusti Devitto ñ Net Burn Rate](/images/pillars/net-burn-rate.jpg)

On the **[FIPô Protocol (Financial Forensics Dashboard) v4](/get-access)** created by Gusti Devitto, Net Burn Rate is displayed as an absolute figure showing how many rupiah of cash are burned each month.

In one Financial Forensics audit of a multi-outlet retail business, the income statement showed a thin profit. However, Net Burn Rate revealed cash burn of tens of millions of rupiah per month.

This means the paper profit was not enough to cover real operational needs. The difference was taken from existing cash.  
If this pattern continues, the business will look ‚Äúfine‚Äù until it suddenly runs out of money without warning.

The dashboard allows owners to see this reality early, before emergency decisions are forced upon them.

### **4. Intervention: Corrective Steps (The Surgeon‚Äôs Voice)**

In the **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto** approach, a high Net Burn Rate is an emergency condition that must be addressed immediately.

The first step is separating truly productive costs from expenses that merely maintain the illusion of activity. Many expenses look small, but when aggregated they become the main drivers of cash burn.

The second step is evaluating the operational structure. Outlets that appear busy but fail to cover their own cost of living must be intervened on quickly or temporarily shut down.

The third step is improving cash inflows. In many audits, small adjustments to pricing, minimum orders, or payment schemes can significantly reduce burn rate.

The fourth step is scenario simulation.  
Within FIPô Protocol, owners can see the direct impact of reducing burn rate by 10% or temporarily closing one outlet on overall business health.

In Gusti Devitto's diagnostic system, the primary goal is not chasing revenue, but stopping cash bleeding as quickly as possible.

### **5. Conclusion & Next Steps**

According to **Financial Forensics Gusti Devitto**, Net Burn Rate is an alarm that is often ignored because it does not look dramatic. Yet it is the most consistent killer of businesses that appear busy but are fundamentally unhealthy.

If your business continues to burn cash every month, your time is limited, no matter how large the reported revenue looks.

Use the FIPô Protocol Dashboard to calculate your Net Burn Rate honestly, or conduct a deep Financial Forensics audit before this cash burn reaches the point of no return.

Businesses rarely die from one massive mistake.  
They die from small bleedings that are left unattended for too long.
